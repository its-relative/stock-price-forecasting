# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Overview

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict the future prices of Reliance Stock (RS). The model is trained on historical data from 2000 to 2024 and evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-Squared (R2) metrics.

## Features

* Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering
* LSTM model training and evaluation
* Prediction of future stock prices
* Visualization of results

## Requirements

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* TensorFlow or Keras for LSTM model implementation
* Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
* Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation metrics

## Usage

* Clone the repository
* Install the required libraries
* Run the data preprocessing script ((link unavailable))
* Run the LSTM model training script ((link unavailable))
* Run the prediction script ((link unavailable))
* Visualize the results using the visualization script ((link unavailable))
